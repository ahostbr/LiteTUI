# LiteTUI Rust — offline visual preview

This is an **interactive mock conversation**, requested so the terminal layout and tool cards can be inspected before runtime integration. It is not the completed Rust port.

## Open it on Windows

Double-click **`open-preview.cmd`** in this folder. It opens a separate, explicitly dark Windows Terminal window. If the executable is missing, the launcher builds it with Cargo first. Without Windows Terminal, it runs in the current console.

From a LiteSuite terminal pane (or any interactive terminal):

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\.worktrees\OpenBolt-rust-tui\rust\litetui-terminal
cargo build --locked
.\target\debug\litetui-rs.exe --preview
```

The binary is at `target/debug/litetui-rs.exe`. Build again after changing source; the double-click launcher only builds a missing binary. `--help` works without a terminal; redirected-pipe interactive launches fail with an actionable error.

## What you can inspect

- A mock user/assistant exchange and a short illustrative reasoning summary.
- Completed tool calls; expanded arguments/results; a simulated running call; a failed-call example.
- A mock write approval that defaults to **Deny**. Both choices only change local fixture text.
- Scrolling, selection, expansion, resize behavior, and a composer that adds local demo turns.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Select next / previous tool |
| Ctrl+E or F2 | Expand / collapse selected tool |
| Ctrl+B | Previous tool |
| Up / Down, PgUp / PgDn, mouse wheel | Scroll transcript |
| Home / End | Start / end of transcript |
| F4 | Open searchable public dark-theme picker |
| Up / Down, Enter, Escape (picker) | Select, apply in memory, cancel |
| F6 | Open the pending mock approval |
| Tab then Enter, or A / D | Choose an action inside the mock approval |
| Escape | Close the mock approval without deciding |
| F5 | Reset/replay the fixture conversation |
| Enter | Add composer text as a local mock turn |
| Ctrl+U | Clear composer |
| Ctrl+Q or Ctrl+C | Exit and restore terminal modes |

Below 36 columns or 14 rows, the preview asks for a resize and suspends decision keys; a hidden approval cannot be confirmed. No full editor, mouse selection, markdown renderer, clipboard integration, backend selector, settings screen, image support or runtime transport is claimed yet.

## Safety and evidence boundary

No Python child, model request, tool execution, real approval, fleet registration or application-data persistence exists in this preview. Named paths, commands, test counts and results in the conversation are **fixtures**, not work actually performed. Typed messages are kept only in memory (six turns maximum); quitting discards them. Cargo/launcher build actions are separate developer operations, not mock tool execution.

The terminal defaults to the source-derived **Ash** palette: borderless amber tool rows on black; rounded gray assistant frames; nested dashed thinking blocks. Ryan accepted this revised visual direction on 2026-10-15 after rejecting the initial generic card redesign. Preserve the layout while wiring runtime events. F4 now offers **36 public dark themes**, generated from LiteTUI and Textual definitions without reading live settings. Search by name, use arrows, then Enter to apply; Escape cancels. F5 replays the fixture without resetting the theme. Semantic tokens drive the same layout across palettes, including resolved thinking/tool/footer overrides. Legacy fixed argument/result grays remain intentional. Selection is in-memory only: real custom-theme editing, runtime catalog loading and saved selection are still required. Synthetic override tests are not custom-theme integration. The terminal uses an explicit dark palette. A cleanup guard restores raw mode, mouse capture, bracketed paste, alternate screen and cursor on normal exit or recoverable errors. Panic handling attempts restoration. Force termination cannot guarantee cleanup.

## Dependencies and Ratty target

Pinned Ratatui **0.30.2**, Crossterm **0.29.0**, and unicode-width **0.2.2**; lockfile committed. Rust 1.92.0 was used to build. The package declares the dependencies' supported Rust floor (1.88), but that older compiler was not tested here.

On 2026-10-15 the upstream Ratty `widget/Cargo.toml` identified the widget as **`ratatui-ratty` 0.4.0**, not the earlier `ratatui-rgp` name. It depends on `ratatui-core = 0.1.2` and uses Ratatui 0.30 / Crossterm 0.29 in examples. This preview resolves the same core line. That is a dependency compatibility observation, **not a tested RGP/inline-3D integration**. No Ratty/GPU dependencies are added.

## Focused verification

```powershell
cargo test --locked
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --locked
```

Tests cover all public palettes, picker search/navigation/input ownership, synthetic custom overrides, narrow layouts, fixture state, mock decisions, modal input isolation, input bounds/control-character filtering, scrolling, explicit dark cells, compact dialog visibility, and actual `TestBackend` resize sequences. They do not establish real-runtime or full terminal-host parity.
